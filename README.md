# üëç Playing with textual library

Collection of examples and libraries to build TUI.
I have created a widget to visualize images using some of these libraries.

## Demo

## Setup

Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the enviroment
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install all the dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage


* The app will run as a terminal user interface app.
```bash
