# üëç Playing with textual libraries

I have created a widget to visualize images on the terminal.

## Demo
Given a picture, for instance a picture of the Spanish women's football team:
![spanish women's football team](https://github.com/pilarcode/textual-image-widget-lab/blob/master/data/world_champions.jpg)

 I would like to see the image on the terminal:
![demo](demos/demo_custom_image_box_widget.png)

Note: I would like to see the image in high resolution.

## Setup

Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the enviroment
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install all the dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage


* The app will run as a terminal user interface app.
```bash
python "examples\textual-my-image-box-widget.py"
```
